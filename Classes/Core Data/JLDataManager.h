 JLDataManager manages the entire Core Data stack, much of which is simply boilerplate code. 
 JLDataManager manages a single NSManagedObjectContext that lives on the main thread while 
 also allowing the class consumer to instantiate more instances with the same core data stack
 on different (or the same) threads. This makes keeping a reference to the object context much
 easier when youâ€™re working with objects on the UI thread.
