#JLComponentLibrary    
*A collection of classes that simplify complex boilerplate code. JLComponentLibrary takes a different approach to simplification. It does not attempt to obfusicate away all of the internals when possible. It will never attempt to assume behavior. Instead, it simply wraps the generic boilerplate that many apps require.*

Complete documentation is available [1][here].

##JLManagedTableViewController
*A subclass of `UITableViewController` that allows easy integration with Core Data, including sorting, sections, deleting, and reordering.*
